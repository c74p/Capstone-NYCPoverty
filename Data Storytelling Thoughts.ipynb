    "- Among raw inputs, PreTaxIncome most strongly correlated with poverty; but other than that, SCHL/SCH/SCHG and WKW/WKHP/ESR should be as well\n",

    "## Questions:\n",
    "- Can we create a statistic that shows cost per person?  \n",
    "- Can we base a meaningful statistic based on average income?\n",
    "- Can we create an estimate of cost to alleviate x% of poverty?\n",
    "- How much would we have to allocate for future budgets to maintain parity? To meet stated goals? To exceed stated goals?\n",
    "- How (and how much) can the city/state/federal government maximize their dollars in combating and alleviating poverty?\n",
    "- Which factors play the largest roles in poverty?\n",
    "    - Costs: housing, food, health care, child care, basic necessities, travel time & cost\n",
    "    - Revenues: wages, cash assistance, non-cash assistance\n",
    "- How much does the minimum wage impact poverty? (Minimum wage changed during certain years of the dataset)\n",
    "    - Other non-poverty effects of minimum wage are outside of scope\n",
    "- How do hourly wages versus hours worked impact the picture?\n",
    "- Is “simply working more hours” a viable alternative? How likely is one to get a higher-paying job, or a job with better benefits (especially health care)?\n",
    "- Demographics: education level, English proficiency, household size/composition\n",
    "    - In particular, if education level or English proficiency are lacking, how much would a “step up” to the next level impact poverty?\n",
    "- How much do larger economic trends impact the overall picture? (Not in scope currently)\n",
    "- How and how much can a person/”poverty unit”/household achieve long-term independence from poverty and near-poverty?\n",
    "    - How can governmental policies support them?\n",
    "- How much does poverty vary between the various boroughs of New York City, and why?  What can we learn from the differences?\n",
    "- How can we “productize” this research to take advantage of future volumes of these annual datasets?\n",
    "- Additional questions that the available data may not address sufficiently but may be worth considering:\n",
    "    - What needs exist that NGOs may attempt to address, that are not currently being addressed or that may grow in the future?\n",
    "    - How should dollars be invested in alleviating the impacts of poverty, versus addressing the root causes?  Does the data support the validity of even asking this question in this way?\n",
    "    - How much does a dollar invested in business-growth incentives compare to, say, a dollar invested in a jobs-training program in addressing poverty?\n",
    "    - A common American perspective (in contrast to some other cultures) depicts the poor as lazy. What can we draw from the data to enrich or illuminate this perspective?\n"
